 ## The reasons I don't use .xib files
 
 I can, and will, use .xib files if asked to, but I don't use them in my own projects for these reasons:
 
 - Change Tracking
 There are dates and codes in .xib files, which are changed every time a developer views them in xcode, 
 which can obscure actual changes in git or similar systems.
 
 Merging changes is also very difficult with .xib files - especially storyboards, 
 which are basically massive xml wrappers containing multiple .xib files.
 
 I have worked as part of a team where three developers made changes to a story board, 
 which were difficult to merge together.
 
 - Readability
 .xib files are huge xml files, which - without loading into xcode -
 are generally very difficult to read for those not extremely familiar with them.
 
 This makes identification of changes difficult because it is difficult to visualise the layout 
 or see what the changes actually are (if any), without loading the .xib into interface builder; 
 for example, when browsing the git repo using a browser.
 
 To see all the settings in a .xib file you have to load it into xcode 
 and check all the little settings for every object.
 
 All non-default settings are clearly laid out when objects are defined in code.
 
 - Flexibility
 Object sizing and placement defined in code can be very flexible, 
 such as using percentages of the view, or other objects in the view, for sizing or placement.
 
 - Debugging
 It's difficult to find little inconsistencies in .xib files that may be causing a problem 
 as you have to select every little piece and carefully inspect all it's little options, 
 whereas any non-default settings are easily identifiable in code.
